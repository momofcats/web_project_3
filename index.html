									Still, as sparsely populated as it was in the 1600s, this is
									an extraordinary and highly underrated state full of rich
									history and majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main state
									you want to be sure not to miss. As your journey is going to
									be a long one, you had best be prepared for an arduous trek.
								</p>
								<p>
									Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first European
									settlers on US territory in the era of Vikings, but is also
									home to L.L. Bean, which is a great company to grab a super
									sturdy backpack from for your 3-month expedition.

								<p>Average cost: $80-100.</p>
